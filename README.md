This tutorial series is written for 2020 using Kotlin and XML. Java is no longer used for Android and is not recommended by Google. In this series we'll learn about Activities, Kotlin classes, navigating between screens and how to build a beautiful User Interface (UI) using XML and ConstraintLayout. Hopefully I'll be able to produce 30 parts over the coming months. As always, I'll put all the code in the videos here. Check back after each video to see the changes.
